# ✅ Task List (aka The Obligatory Developer Rite)

> “It’s not a real GitHub profile if there isn’t at least one ToDo app.” 🙃

---

Welcome to my extremely essential, historically accurate, and utterly unsurprising **Task List project**.  
Built with pure, unfiltered JavaScript and CSS, because… well, sometimes you just gotta keep it old-school.  
Don’t expect React, TypeScript, or any modern magic here — just good old HTML, CSS, and JS doing their thing.

---

## 🤷 Why does this exist?

- Because every dev portfolio in the universe has at least one.
- Because you never forget your first `.push()` to an array.
- Because I needed *something* to pin here while my more serious project is on the way.

## 🚀 Features (if you squint)

- [x] Add tasks (wow!)
- [x] Remove tasks (incredible!)
- [x] Mark tasks as completed (groundbreaking!)
- [x] Gaze upon your productivity (or lack thereof)
